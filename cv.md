## About me
I am a technical support specialist with 2+ years of experience working with hardware and software, graduate of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics and I am planning to become a front-end developer.

## My skills (summary)
* Basic HTML 5
* Basic CSS3
* Basic JavaScript
* Basic Git
* Basic Python 
* Basic SQL

## Code example
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.
What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.
Test.assertDeepEquals(count("aba"), { a: 2, b: 1 });
Test.assertDeepEquals(count(""), {});

...
function count (string) {
let sortedString = string.split('').sort();
let fArray = {};
...
  sortedString.forEach(function(x) {
   let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < sortedString.length; i++){
...
  if (x == sortedString[i]) {
    count += 1;
  }
...
    fArray[x] = count;
   }});
   return fArray;
   }
...

## English
I’ve studied English at school and university. Now I usually watch TV series and shows in original voice acting, play computer games and read articles in English.
